# recipes

This repo contains the first project for *The Odin Project*: the recipes page, intended to be used as practice with **HTML** and **Git**, utilising basic concepts such as:

- Using the `img`, `a`, `h` and `p` elements
- Using relative and absolute links in the `img` and `a` elements' attributes
- Using `ul`, `ol`, and `li`
- Structuring directories and files for a project

in order to create a website of interlinked recipe pages.
