    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><span>Whisk</span> garlic, rice vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, Sriracha, hoisin, and sesame oil together in a mixing bowl for the dressing.</li>
        <li><span>Tear</span> chicken apart into strands similar in width to the spaghetti. <span>Refrigerate</span> until ready to use.</li>
        <li><span>Bring</span> a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. <span>Cook</span> spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. <span>Drain</span> and <span>rinse</span> with cold water.</li>
        <li><span>Transfer</span> spaghetti to a mixing bowl; <span>add</span> the chicken, carrots, bell pepper, and green onions. <span>Pour</span> in the dressing and toss by hand until well combined. <span>Seal</span> the surface of the salad with plastic wrap and <span>refrigerate</span>, tossing occasionally, for 2 to 12 hours, the longer the better.</li>
